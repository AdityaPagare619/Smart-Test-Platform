**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Key sections:**
- Executive summary (30 min)
- Phase overview (1 hour)
- Layer specifications (1 hour)

### 2. CR-V4-Technical-Stack-Architecture.md (READ THIS TOMORROW)
**Purpose:** Understand how to build it  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Key sections:**
- Technology stack (30 min)
- Database design (1 hour)

## MOST CRITICAL POINTS (DON'T FORGET)

### 1. This is TDD (Tests First)
Every piece of code starts with a test. You write the test that fails, then make it pass.

```python
# WRONG: Write code, then test
def select_next_question():
    # ... implementation
    pass

# RIGHT: Test first, then code
def test_selector_chooses_right_difficulty():
    # This test fails right now
    assert something == expected
    
# Then implement to make test pass
def select_next_question():
    # ... implementation
```

### 2. Foundation is Critical (Weeks 1-2)
Everything depends on the database and algorithms being perfect. Don't rush this.

**Week 1 Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Loading incomplete concept data
- ❌ Skipping test writing
- ❌ Not validating schema before moving on
- ❌ Ignoring database indexes

### 3. Simulation Validates Everything (Weeks 7-9)
This is where you find bugs. Run 100 synthetic students through 30 days.

**Key simulation validations:**
- ✅ High achievers improve >30%
- ✅ Struggling students improve 5-15%
- ✅ Burnout detected in 70% of at-risk
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ APIs respond <200ms

### 4. No DevOps Until Testing Done
Database and layers first. Infrastructure comes later. This is intentional.

**Order:**
1. ✅ Code it (Weeks 1-9)
2. ✅ Test it with simulation (Weeks 7-9)
3. ✅ Deploy it (Weeks 10-12)

### 5. Each Layer is Independent
Layers can be built in parallel by different engineers.

**Team can split:**
- Engineer 1: Layers 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 (Knowledge/Optimization)
- Engineer 2: Layers 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 (Assessment/Engagement)

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH

### Week 1-2
🚩 Database schema not finalized → **Stop, fix it**  
🚩 Tests not written first → **Start over with TDD**  
🚩 Algorithms not validated → **Run math through Slack with AI**  
🚩 >10% test coverage gaps → **Fix before moving forward**  

### Week 3-6
🚩 Layers not integrating → **Sync layers daily**  
🚩 API responses >500ms → **Optimize or rearchitect**  
🚩 Database queries >100ms → **Add indexes immediately**  
🚩 Simulation showing wrong results → **Debug simulation, not engine**  

### Week 7-9
🚩 Simulation metrics missing targets → **Pause, debug engine**  
🚩 High achievers not improving → **Check algorithm logic**  
🚩 Burnout not detected → **Review burnout layer**  
🚩 Data inconsistencies → **Check database integrity**
