## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR ENGINEERING TEAM

### Why This Works

1. **No ML Training Needed**
   - JEE strategy is deterministic, not probabilistic
   - Rules-based approach faster to market
   - Transparent (vs black-box ML)

2. **3 Subject Engines (Not 1)**
   - Chemistry: Breadth-first (coverage matters)
   - Physics: High-yield selective (ROI optimization)
   - Math: Sequential mandatory (cannot skip)
   - Each student gets appropriate strategy

3. **Adaptive Timelines (Not 1 Fixed)**
   - Fresh 11th starter: 24-month arc
   - 12th student 6 months before: Crisis mode
   - Each timeline completely different
   - Same engine, infinite paths

4. **Psychology Built-In (Not Afterthought)**
   - Burnout detection at 80% risk threshold
   - Honest rank projection (not hype)
   - Confidence calibration (not fake)
   - Engagement hooks for each phase

5. **Scalability Without Cost**
   - Pre-cached architecture (0 latency)
   - Supabase free tier initially
   - No per-student ML cost
   - Proven for 1M+ users
