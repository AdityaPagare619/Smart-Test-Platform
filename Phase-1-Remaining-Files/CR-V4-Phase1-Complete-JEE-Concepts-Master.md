└─ RECOVERY: Molecular orbital diagram for O₂ shows 2 unpaired

MISCONCEPTION 305: "pH = -log[H⁺] everywhere"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Ignoring strong base contexts
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: pOH = -log[OH⁻], and pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "What's pH of 0.1 M NaOH solution?"
└─ RECOVERY: Strong base formula [OH⁻] = concentration directly

MISCONCEPTION 306: "Resonance means structure changes with time"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Quantum mechanics interpretation error
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Resonance structures don't actually inter-convert; reality is hybrid
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "Do benzene ring electrons jump between structures?"
└─ RECOVERY: True structure is superposition of resonance forms

MISCONCEPTION 307: "Oxidation state = charge"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Conflating formal and oxidation oxidation states
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Oxidation state assumes full electron transfer; charge is actual
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "What's oxidation state of S in H₂S vs H₂SO₄?"
└─ RECOVERY: Oxidation state rules applied systematically
```

#### **REACTION MISCONCEPTIONS**

```
MISCONCEPTION 401: "Endothermic reactions don't happen"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Confusing ΔH with ΔG
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Endothermic can occur if ΔG < 0 (entropy-driven)
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "Can ice melt at 0°C even though it needs heat input?"
└─ RECOVERY: Gibbs free energy explanation (ΔG = ΔH - TΔS)

MISCONCEPTION 402: "Catalyst changes ΔG of reaction"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Mistaking speed with thermodynamics
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Catalyst only lowers Ea; ΔG unchanged
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "Does adding catalyst make unfavorable reaction favorable?"
└─ RECOVERY: Reaction coordinate diagram with/without catalyst

MISCONCEPTION 403: "Equilibrium means reaction stopped"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Confusing static vs dynamic
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Dynamic equilibrium - forward/reverse rates equal
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "At equilibrium, are reactants being consumed?"
└─ RECOVERY: Isotope labeling experiment conceptually explained

MISCONCEPTION 404: "SN2 inversion means stereochemistry flips"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Oversimplification without mechanism
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: SN2 causes inversion; SN1 can lead to racemization
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "(R)-substrate + SN2 → ? stereoisomer"
└─ RECOVERY: Walden inversion mechanism, transition state geometry

MISCONCEPTION 405: "Aromatic rings always undergo addition reactions"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Confusing with alkenes
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: Aromaticity favors substitution over addition
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "Does benzene undergo addition like alkenes?"
└─ RECOVERY: Aromatic stability (resonance) explanation

MISCONCEPTION 406: "Carboxylic acid acidity comes from -OH group"
└─ FALSE CONTEXT: Ignoring C=O stabilization
└─ CORRECT CONCEPT: O=C-O⁻ resonance stabilizes conjugate base
└─ DIAGNOSTIC: "Why is HCOOH more acidic than CH₃OH?"
└─ RECOVERY: Conjugate base stability comparison
