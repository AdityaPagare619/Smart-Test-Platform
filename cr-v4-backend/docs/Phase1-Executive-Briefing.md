## 📚 MISCONCEPTIONS DOCUMENTED (320+ Items)

### Critical High-Severity Misconceptions

1. **MATH_005**: x² = 4 → x = 2 only (misses x = -2)
2. **MATH_038**: Incorrectly applying product/chain rule
3. **MATH_046**: Integration formula errors
4. **PHYS_001**: Heavier objects fall faster (Galileo myth)
5. **PHYS_004**: Moving object MUST have force
6. **PHYS_007**: Centrifugal force is real in inertial frames
7. **PHYS_012**: KE depends on direction (it's scalar!)
8. **PHYS_034**: Magnetic force changes particle speed
9. **CHEM_008**: Larger atom = more electronegative (false!)
10. **CHEM_040**: All SN2 reactions invert stereochemistry

## 🎯 BLOOM'S TAXONOMY ALIGNMENT

### Distribution Across 6 Levels

| Level | Name | % of Assessment | Focus |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Remember | 10% | Definitions, formulas |
| 2 | Understand | 15% | Explain, classify |
| 3 | Apply | 30% | Solve standard problems |
| 4 | Analyze | 20% | Compare, differentiate |

| 6 | Create | 5% | Design, prove |

### Application Examples

**Level 3 (Apply):** "Solve 3x² - 6x + 2 = 0 using quadratic formula"
**Level 4 (Analyze):** "Why must discriminant > 0 for real roots?"
**Level 5 (Evaluate):** "Verify your solution by substitution. Is it reasonable?"
**Level 6 (Create):** "Design a quadratic equation with roots 3 and -5"
