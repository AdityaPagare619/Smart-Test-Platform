Ok so now lets start in depth working and planning and designing for the simulation to 
test actually is the ai engine working perfectly all layes, all together any single chance of
 failure or every single thing monitored and the flow and logic of simulation will be such 
 detailed way that , it will fit perfectly
 simulate the users their timings of loging in on our platform like every single things should be as the real world feeling. 
So my team has conducted some research n how a simulation could be Read and understand all in depth att , @SIMULATION-DETAILS and a file @SIMULATION-RESEARCH-1.md so that you will understand the level of perfection and scale our chief departments and the council thinkig. 
though many things maybe what the research assumiing not applied , here we will take all the neccesary details from the document and build the simulation according to the existing ready working ai engine too tests whether its actually working or not, like these doc just tells overall idea and depth how the simulaiton should be considreed but as many things it wouldhave missed as in depth your team, the chief departmenbts from all our domains, techniucal, cto and all the chief best coincils of ours knows about our engine we had currently working. 
So I want you to know Generate a document , ultra comprehesive ultra detailed and no lenght limit of lines considered work like a proper full cpmany togther as we ere from start, debating, giving honest opininos, everyones participation and bestknowledge and expertise, each experts should debate argue with the ethics and honesty.
You will design a extremly advanced and best ultra detailed comprehensive document and the research report via whihc we will start with a final coucnil approval only not a single biased or not a single gap allowed, and designing for current ai engine existing the http and all other lets not considr now on but yes properly we will have to check if such huge load of data created, thrown to the ai engine how effieciently it could handle with what performacne and everuy single index calculated and monitored very very wisely and perfectly. 
Also the logic of stydents sides, the simulation working should be extremyl on point with desgning a perfect architeture , logic flow the work flow, also we know that we have some users for 2 years also direct or some for the 1 month only, and like simulation is for testing different conditions and rela world sceanrios we had buiold many layers so like there are many conditions or scenarios happening in the real world for handlijng them we have buid these layers, like what if student did these then how will ai system or the engine react, what if it took break so like in simulation also there should be beahviours like those and many many random also which the ai system or the engine is not ready for got it, so that we could know also that what will happen if engine encountered a conditinos which as exceptional or not designed so that properly also checking what action ai engine took , a perfect simulation systems are those which not just replicate real world but a perfect system which could be perfect for testing, improving, finding flaws, monitroing systems, etc every single scarios .
So take as much as time it could take to you we dont have any hurry and I want you to create the most detailed DOcument a Simualtion document in which every every single parts of simulation debates all other points raised, concerns, advantages, pores all we have and how we made a simulation system for current ai engine to test it so you got it. Every single layer would be juged byb the simulation systems certain part, each step by every side will bbe monitored if council said to monitor or like comment on data ai llm could be used then we could use a perplexity pro api key or the gemini pro api key, so in depth honest opinions and the final decssions with all the evry single departments approval, and a chief departments of the simualtion and the data scientis and the algoithms all the engineering team will work hard to implement , find best ways,etc .
So do your work on your own ethics read all the neccesary docs, formulas very very carefully dont leave a single keyword or a line, we want best to best and fully ready to build simulation system got it, so these document could be even more than 200 pages or even more as it will cover like every single point , deatiled minurte to minute raised and found , studied, researched ,etc.
So team work harder and best smartlky my all 1000+ employees gather students experts, exam experts also coouncil bbe honest and parctical not partial.
